My current projects are as follows. For detailed notes and codes please visit my website \href{https://sites.google.com/view/arghyab/home}{\color{NavyBlue} An Artichoke and Algorithm}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \justifying{\textbf{External Memory Algorithms:} Programs running on most modern systems experience memory fluctuations. Memory fluctuations cause performance degradation of a program. This research empirically shows that cache-obliviousness is a good starting point to adapt to memory fluctuations typically observed in practice. However, cache-obliviousness is not sufficient to achieve cache-adaptivity in adversarial memory fluctuations.}
    
    \item \justifying{\textbf{Filesystem Aging:} I study aging or fragmentation framework for several filesystems including a write-optimized in-kernel filesystem \textit{BetrFS}. I study intrafile and interfile microbenchmarks, application level aging of files, sequential read performance of aged single large file, and the effect of fullness versus usage of disk on aging of filesystems.}
    
    \item \justifying{\textbf{Machine Learning Augmented Algorithms:} I study design and applications of machine learning augmented algorithms on the following domains: traditional online problems such as \textit{Ski Rental}, \textit{Competitive Paging} and probabilistic data structures such as \textit{Bloom Filter}, \textit{Packed Memory Array}. My notes on \textit{Balls and Bins} problems and \textit{Tail Inequalities} are \href{https://sites.google.com/view/arghyab/research}{here}.}
